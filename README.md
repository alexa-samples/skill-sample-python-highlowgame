Build An Alexa High Low Game Skill using ASK Python SDK
=========================================

This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic high-low game skill. The high low game is a game where the player tries to guess the target number between 1 to 100. After each incorrect guess, the player is informed if the target number is higher or lower than their current guess. This continues until the target number is guessed or the player gives up. This sample Alexa Skill is written in Python and demonstrates the use of session and persistent attributes.
